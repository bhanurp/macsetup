# Software Installation JSON Samples

This folder contains sample JSON files that can be used as templates for automating the installation, verification, and management of various software tools. Each JSON file represents a structured format for installing and verifying specific software using standard commands.

## Structure

Each JSON file includes:
- **`name`**: The name of the software.
- **`install_command`**: The command to install the software.
- **`verify_command`**: A command to verify the software installation.
- **`notes`**: Additional information or context about the software.

### Example JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "name": "example-software",
    "install_command": "brew install example-software",
    "verify_command": "example-software --version",
    "notes": "This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes."
  }
]
```

## How to Use

1. **Reuse**: Copy any of the provided JSON samples into your project for automation purposes.
2. **Update**: Modify the `install_command`, `verify_command`, or `notes` fields as needed to suit your specific requirements.
3. **Extend**: Add new JSON files for additional software by following the structure outlined in the example.

## Why Use These JSON Files?

- **Consistency**: Maintain a uniform structure for software installation instructions.
- **Reusability**: Adapt and reuse the JSON samples by moving them into ~/.macsetup directory
